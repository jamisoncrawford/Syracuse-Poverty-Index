## Syracuse Index

**Description:** An index of historical data of community indicators in Syracuse's 55 census tracts, normalized and scored for comparability and aggregated to indicate the overall economic and social health of each census tract.

**Software:** All data wrangling, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization is done using R (v. 3.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v. 1.1.414) using Windows 10. Packages include, but are not limited to:

* tidyr
* dplyr
* readr
* lubridate
* stringr
* gpplot2
* ggmap
* tmap
* sp
* sf
* broom
* tigris
* zoo

**Data & Sources:** Data are compiled in the Central New York Community Foundation (CNYCF) database, in both wide and long ("tidy") format. Sources currently include Census' American Community Survey (ACS), Syracuse Department of Neighborhood & Business Development (NBD), Onondaga County Department of Social Services (DSS), Department of Labor (DOL), and crime data from Syracuse.com.

**Objective:** Since data sources are from local service providers and data intermediaries, indicators in the Index serve as a far more accurate, robust measure for "moving" the proverbial "needle", a far superior measure of community health than Census estimates.

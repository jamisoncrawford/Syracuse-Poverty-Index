## Syracuse Poverty Index

**Description:** An index of historical data of community indicators in Syracuse's 55 census tracts, normalized and scored for comparability and aggregated to indicate the overall economic and social health of each census tract.

**Variable Definitions:** See `CodeBook.md`.

**Software:** All data wrangling, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization is done using R (v. 3.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v. 1.1.414) using Windows 10.

**Objective:** Since data sources are from local service providers and data intermediaries, indicators in the Index serve as a far more accurate, robust measure for "moving" the proverbial "needle", a far superior measure of community health than Census estimates.
